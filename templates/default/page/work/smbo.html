<h2>Why SortMyBooks Online?</h2>

<p><a href="http://aislingsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Aisling Software</a> is a well-known publisher of accounting software for SMEs. They have approached <u>Agile</u> with a very large project to develop complete accoutning software on-line from scratch.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with accounting software – you know how difficult it is to even start using one of those. Client for SortMyBooks Online primarily are owners of small companies and retail shops. We knew – in order to get their approval, not only applicaiton, but the whole concept of "easy-to-use" accounting have to be designed</p>

<h2>Making of</h2>

<p>When our companies started to work together, we focused on research, usability studies and planning. Our prototype design went through about 4 iterations before it was considered perfect. For each workflow we asked ourselves - <i>How can we make this intuitive for a person with zero knowledge of accounting practices?</i>. Invoices, payments, tills, time tracking and reconcilations – those are some of the major screens.</p>

<p>Our other challenge was planning of scalable, secure and flexible backend for the application. The code base had to be designed to function in multiple countires, in multiple languages, in multiple feature-configuration and permission levels.</p>

<p>Both teams of Agile and Aisling did a tremendeous job. When we started to showing our early betas to enterpreneurs and accountants, both were amazed and impressed.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>SortMyBooks Online is a serious application. Developed from the very star on top of Agile Toolkit with tight jQuery UI integration it become a solid foundation for business logic and UI. Software runs on PHP5, Linux and MySQL5.1. Early development and betas were hosted on Amazon cloud services then moved to our partners at cInfinity.</p>
