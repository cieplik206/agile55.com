<p>Transpoco tracks vehicles for companies, organisations and government bodies.&#160;They required front CRM updated and backend mapping solution improvement. Agile improved existing software to give better and faster reports, reviews and easy management.&#160;</p><p><em>“To tell the truth, I didn’t expect such a good result. Agile Technologies managed to optimise our existing Web 2.0 system, and now it works much faster than before. It’s not so easy to find a company that does their work well. But they are doing their job PERFECTLY”</em> &#160;Barry Cronin, Transpoco.com</p><div class="image clearing"><div class="image-wrap"><img src="/templates/default/images/portfolio/big/case-transpoco.jpg" alt="Transpoco front page" /></div></div>
