	   <p><b>Below are skills for ideal applicant. If you are lacking some of those - that's fine - we have training program
	   for our new employees where you will be able to catch up with the rest of us.</b></p>

	   <p>Primary skills we are looking for in our applicatns are:
	   <ul><li>self-motivation;</li>
	   <li>precision;</li>
	   <li>creativity;</li>
	   <li>efficiency.</li>
	   </ul>
	   We are interested in hiring people in age 22-30 who are very passionate about their development.</p>

	   <p>Ideal applicant should have a bachelors degree in computer science and should be familiar with <a
	   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory">algorythm efficiency</a>
	   and optimization to some degree. You must understand how to write code efficiency, be very well familiar with <a
	   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object oriented programming practices</a> and
	   use them fluently. 2 year experience in PHP is required, but you should know how to develop
	   in some other object-oriented language such as Java, Pascal or C++. You should also be familiar with abstraction and
	   development of universal code and routines. You must be adaptive in terms of coding style</p>

	   <p>Applicant should be comfortable with working in Linux command-line environment, vim, using Subversion or Git. You
	   should also be able to install <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a>, <a
	   href="http://www.google.com/images?q=lamp&hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&prmd=ivsn&resnum=3&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1213&bih=850">LAMP</a>
	   or <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a> on your local computer and develop localy. Code you
	   develop should be properly commented and very efficient in terms of lines-of-code, CPU and Memory. You must know and
	   use all the available resources of underlying language. You are encouraged to introduce improvements and enhancements,
	   create reusable addons and modules and also
	   providing documentation for them.</p>

	   <p>You must feel comfortable with your skills. When presented with a task you should be able to estimate how much time
	   it would take for you to develop. You must be able to work in a team, collaborate, put suggestions and use on-line
	   collaboration tools - email, jabber, voice confernce, screen sharing.</p>

	   <p>It is rather important that you could touch-type and be able to type at least 40 words per minute in
	   English. When it comes to jabber conversation â€“ if you are struggling to find the right keys - it's slowing down work
	   of your team-mates.</p>

	   <p>English understanding is most essential. Often you would need to understand feedback provided by our clients, which
	   sometimes is not very straightforward. We would be glad to offer you help if you have questions, but you should be
	   able to figure things out on your own.</p>

	   <p>Finally - we are offering you a full-time position. Which means that we expect you to work solely for Agile. We do
	   not expect you to overwork, merely be productive and effective. If you do not have immediate tasks then it's your job
	   to find out what you can work on next. If no task is available - work on self-improvement. You will need to build a
	   habit of tracking time you spend. We are not too picky about your time, but we need to know which project you have
	   worked on. This is important for budget allocation and our internal accounting and project management.</p>
