                <p>What differentiates our team from others is that we are not following the industry - we lead it.

                While many other teams use opensource tools like CodeIgniter and Wordpress, we are on a completely
                different level. We released <a href="http://agiletoolkit.org/" target="_blank">Agile Toolkit</a>
                in 2011 and it is already adopted by tens of thousands developers around the world.
