        h2 Project Devleopment Philosophy
        <img src="<?public?>images/schemas-process.png<?/?>" class="atk-jackscrew"/>
        p Our core principles are "efficiency", "visibility" and "flexibility". That's why when it comes to Software as a Service
            | application development, we have a lot of generic modules and an amazing framework to build your project
            | on. Yet we do respect your intellectual property and any business code we produce for you would be there,
            | isolated from the rest of the software assets.

            | project and you get the final choice of picking which features you want included into the first development
            | phase. The price you see is the final project price, no hidden cost.

            | product. Once phase is complete and accepted, it can be installed on production servers. There
            | is no limit limit on time between iterations.

        p Our project quotation are all no-commitment. You can (and should) compare our quotation with other possible
            | suppliers and chose the most suitable team for your project. Getting your quote is really simple.
