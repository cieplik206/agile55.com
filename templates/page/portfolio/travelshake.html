<p>Travelshake.com required new portal to be built from scratch - more social and engaging website that would help their customers get more business.</p><p>We developed portal with&#160;videos, twitters,&#160;Facebook&#160;and latest offers. Users can explore their area through Google Maps or search from tag clouds.</p><p><em>“Romans, Gita and the team at Agile have delivered us a great website, on time and with little fuss. They found a solution to every problem we encountered during the build and were always efficient, professional and expert in their approach to the project. They are great technology partners to have.”</em>&#160;Laughlin Rigby, Travelshake.com</p><div class="image clearing"><div class="image-wrap"><img src="/public/images/portfolio/big/case-travelshake.jpg" alt="Travelshake" /></div><div class="image-comment">Profile page</div></div>
