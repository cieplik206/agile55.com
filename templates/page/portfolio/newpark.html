<p>Newpark, a co-educational secondary school located in Blackrock, Dublin required a website with a CMS so that they could update their content themselves. We created website designed to match the Newpark brand. Pupils, parents and teachers can go to the website and find out the latest news and events, subscribe to the school newsletter, find out about parent teacher meetings and much more.</p><p>It was a joy to work with a Newpark in partnership with <a href="http://www.getlisted.ie" title="GetListed">GetListed</a> and to develop a website for their students, parents and teachers.</p><div class="image clearing"><div class="image-wrap"><img src="/public/images/portfolio/big/case-newpark1.jpg" alt="Newpark's front page" /></div><div class="image-comment">Front page</div></div><div class="image clearing"><div class="image-wrap"><img src="/public/images/portfolio/big/case-newpark2.jpg" alt="Newpark's day to day interface" /></div><div class="image-comment">Day to Day interface</div></div>
