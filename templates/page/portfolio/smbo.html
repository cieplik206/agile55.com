            <h3>What Client Says?</h3>
            <p>
            Agile team started working on the SortMyBooks in 2008 and their
            experience contributed to everything starting from the database
            model and MVC structure up to the design of user interface.</p>

            <p>
            There were no "what client says â€” goes". We were all part of a
            team. Sometimes developers would reject our ideas and
            counter-propose better ones. Discussions heated as we looked
            for the perfect way to solve things.</p>
            
            <p>The late working hours certainly paid up and resulted in a
            solid, fast, scalable and flexible online software.
