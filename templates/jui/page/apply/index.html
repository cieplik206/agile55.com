			    <h3>Home Office</h3>
				<p>Traditionally in order to get a job, you would need to a major city or even a different country. However if you
				are not a big fan of spending 2 hours traveling every day and you can motivate yourself to be productive in the
				comfort of your own home, that's perfectly fine with us.</p>
		
				<h3>World-class salary</h3>
				<p>If your only goal is salary, than you should work for Microsoft. We start working every day because we want to
				make this world a better place. We want to invent and leave a footprint, to become known on a international level.
				Said that - we pay a good salary regardless of which country and city you live in. Stock options is a possibility.</p>
		
			    <h3>Growth Options</h3>
				<p>Working in local company your growth is limited by many silly rules and conditions. We are quite flexible about
				the salary and would like to pay our developers based on the value they contribute. If you are twice as
				productive, than our other contractor, you can as well receive twice the salary.</p>
		
			    <h3>Creative and challenging projects</h3>
			    <p>Have you ever built a web cluster solution? Have you made an application which handles over thousand requests per
			    second? How about making one within 2 months time? Our typical projects last 1-2 months and then you would move on to
				next project. Our continues to provide consultancy for our clients and participate in major advancements of those
				projects.
		 	    </p>
		 
			    <h3>Open-Source technologies</h3>
			    <p>We are strong opponents of open-source technologies and standard approach. We use PHP5, Apache, Linux and MySQL in
				our projects. We have released our own PHP UI Framework which is also licensed as open-source. We like jQuery, SVN,
				Git, Mantis, Redmine and we have developed quite a lot of our internal software to help our needs.

				<h3>Flexible work hours</h3>
				<p>Few people of our teams prefer to spend they day with family and work in the evening and during night hours. That
				is OK with us. As long as you can work productively for 8 hours per day and are fulfilling your expectations you are
				welcome to organise your own time the way you like.</p>
		
			    <h3>Having Fun</h3>
				<p>The most important aspect of our daily work is to have fun and enjoy what we are doing. If that means that you
				need to take your laptop and work in the mountains or relocate to your summerhouse or travel and camp around the
				house, why not?</p>
		
			   <h3>Hackers at Work</h3>
			   <p>In a sense we are hackers (meaning a very skilled coders, not a criminals). When two or three of us stay late in
			   the office with supply of pizza and coke and code away until 6am fueled by our passion and effect of "flow", we
			   can achieve a magnificent results. Usually those events are followed by sleeping in next day and some very satisfying
			   results.</p>
		
			   <h3>Legal Setup</h3>
			   <p>We hire you as a permanent off-site contractor. You would need to sign NDA and a standard Contract. Your salary is
			   paid monthly through wire transfer. It is your responsibility to register yourself as self-employed or form your own
			   company, whichever works for you tax-wise. We can offer set-up help if you are resident of Latvia, Ireland or Ukraine</p>
		
			  <h3>Ready to Take Next Step?</h3>

			  the bar? Do you feel confident that you could match the challenge? <a href="<?process_url?>process.html<?/?>">Learn more about application
