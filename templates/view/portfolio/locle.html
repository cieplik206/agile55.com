            <h3>In a nutshell</h3>

            <p>
                <em>"We are in a hurry"</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                That's what Locle told us. They have just won Eircom innovation award and
                they needed to have the new Eircom-branded version of their Location-based
                social network in.... WEEKS.
            </p>

            <p>
                We took the challenge and day before the deadline eircom.locle.com was there.
