    <p>AppsFuel is a mobile apps publisher, which makes it possible to deploy HTML5 free and paid apps across multiple platforms and providers.</p>
    <p>We have worked with AppsFuel to architect the initial concept of their software on top of Agile Toolkit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Agile Toolkit is used extensively in this awesome platform. While our team have helped "Dada Entertainment" - company behind AppsFuel initially, they have managed to move development in-house and also have became one of the most active contributors for Agile Toolkit: https://github.com/appsFuel/</li>
